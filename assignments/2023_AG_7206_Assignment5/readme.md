# 2023_AG_7206_Assignment5

This folder contains the submission for **Assignment 5**.  

## 📄 Folder Contents
- **Assignment5.pdf** – Contains the question statements.  
- **Q1.NaiveBayes.py, Q2.GaussianNiveBayse.py, Q3.LinearRegression.py** – Each Python file contains the complete solution for the respective question.  
  - In each file, the **Python code** is written first.  
  - The **output** is provided just below the code (in the footer of the file) as obtained after running it.  
- **Submit_Assignment5.pdf** – Handwritten solution file.  

## ⚙️ Notes
- The Python files contain **absolute and correct results**, directly computed using Python.  
- The **handwritten file** may have minor differences due to rounding (two decimal point approximations).  
- The code computes results based on the **highest probability** — it manually checks and compares all probabilities.  
- In the handwritten solution, the probability of `M` was calculated directly, and `B` was obtained as `B = 1 - M`.  
  This causes small differences between the code and handwritten results.  

## ✅ Summary
This submission demonstrates the correct implementation and manual understanding of Gaussian Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression using Python.  
Both code and handwritten work are included for clarity and comparison.  

**Thank you!**
